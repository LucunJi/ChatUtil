# ChatUtil

-----------------------------------
ChatUtil is capable of copying and pasting texts in your chat
 box.
 
Now downloads are available in curseforge: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chatutil
 
Hold *Shift* and *click/drag*, you can select multiple lines.

Then press *Ctrl+Shift+C* to put these lines into your chipboard.

Use command `/chat buffer <20-1024>` to set the buffer size of your chat box.

Using regex can help you filter your messages.

Use `/chat filter set <name> <regex>` to define a expression with a name, then use `/chat filter use <name> [buffer_filtered=true]` to implement your expression. `buffer_filtered` option sets if game stores the filtered messages in buffer(default true).

In normal chats, use `\{pos}` to post your position quickly.

Feel free to use this mod anywhere, cuz it's released under license [CC0-1.0](./LICENSE) .

Fell free to report issues ;)
