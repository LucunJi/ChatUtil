# ChatUtil

-----------------------------------
ChatUtil is capable of copying and pasting texts in your chat
 box.
 
Hold *Shift* and *click/drag*, you can select multiple lines.

Then press *Ctrl+Shift+C* to put these lines into your
 chipboard.
 
Also, you can expand the buffer size of your chat box.

Use command `/chat buffer <20-1024>` to set.

Using regex can help you filter your messages.

Use `/chat filter set <name> <regex>` to define a expression
 with a name,
then use `/chat filter use <name>` to implement your expression.

Feel free to use this mod anywhere, cuz it's released under license [CC0-1.0](./LICENSE) !

Oh, is fine if you did't see some of the aforementioned function or there might be some bugs.

This mod is still under development. Please be patient and fell free to report issues ;)
